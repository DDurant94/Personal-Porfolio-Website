In this foundation for a personal website portfolio, I follow the best coding practices for HTML5 and CSS3 with a well-thought-out structure. 
I’ve labeled each section and set up classes for adding CSS3 styles. My website comprises nine different pages, each 
showcasing something different about me. It highlights my journey as a software developer and provides insights into my personality. 
Additionally, I demonstrate the skills I’ve acquired during my time at Coding Temple and my managerial expertise in my current role.
