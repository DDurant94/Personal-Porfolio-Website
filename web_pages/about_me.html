      <h3>About Me: Balancing Life's Weights</h3>

      <p>
        Hello! Im Daniel, and I am a single father of two beautiful boys and here's a glimpse into my life:
      </p>

      <h3>Dad Mode: Two Boys, Infinite Adventures</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Dad of Two:</strong> My proudest title! I have two incredible boys—one who's 9 years old (already a mini philosopher) and another 
        who's 3 (a tornado of curiosity). They keep me on my toes, whether we're building LEGO masterpieces or having deep discussions about 
        dinosaurs and how the universe works.
      </p>

      <h3>Work Zone: Elevating Grains and Challenges</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Grain Elevator Manager:</strong> For 55 hours each week, I'm knee-deep in grain—literally. As a manager at our local grain elevator, 
        I oversee operations, troubleshoot conveyor belts, and ensure the smooth flow of golden kernels. It's a job that combines 
        logistics, teamwork, and a dash of dusty adventure.
      </p>


      <h3>Iron and Grit: Power-lifting Passion</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Competitive Power-lifter:</strong> When I'm not lifting grain sacks, I'm lifting iron plates. Power-lifting is my 
        escape—a chance to push my limits, both physically and mentally. The barbell becomes my canvas, and each lift tells a story 
        of resilience and determination.
      </p>


      <h3>Coding Odyssey: From 0s and 1s to Web Magic</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Coding Temple Student:</strong> Yes, you read that right. After long days at work and intense power-lifting sessions, I dive into the 
        world of code. At Coding Temple, I unravel the mysteries of algorithms, dance with Python, and dream of elegant websites. 
        It's like flexing my brain muscles after flexing my biceps.
      </p>


      <h3>Late Nights and Dreams</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Late-Night Coder:</strong> When the house is quiet, and the boys are dreaming of dinosaurs and exploring the universe, 
        I huddle over my laptop. Lines of code become my lullabies, and GitHub repositories my bedtime stories.
      </p>


      <h3>Why I Juggle It All</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>The Why:</strong> Because life isn't about balance; it's about harmonizing chaos. My boys inspire me to learn, 
        my work fuels my purpose, and power-lifting reminds me that strength isn't just physical—it's mental, too. And coding? 
        Well, that's my canvas for creating digital worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, welcome to my corner of the internet. Here, you'll find a mix of dad jokes, code snippets, and maybe even a grain elevator 
        meme or two. Stick around—I promise it won't be boring!
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember: Life's weights may be heavy, but the gains are worth it.
